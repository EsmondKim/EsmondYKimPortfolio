# CSS--Bootsrap-responsivePortfolio

I am passionate about solving problems with computer code, and I hope this portfolio page reflects that.
I created this portfolio as a student in the Fall 2020 University of Minnesota Full Stack Web Development Coding Boot Camp. I envision adding to it and continually updating it as long as I am working because I know the best coders are always striving to improve their skills and learn new things.
When I examine who I am as a person, how I think, how I work, and what I want to contribute to the world, I see myself as a web developer or software developer. A good friend of mine, who is a successful back end programmer, told me "The computer is the game, and writing code that works is winning the game." I love the game, and I am ready to play.
